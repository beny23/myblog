I'm on the plane returning from a [Scan Agile](https://scan-agile.org) conference that was just joyful. What made it that way?
Was it the setting in the gorgeous looking Paastorni conference centre, was it the fact that the hotel was next door
or was it because the speaker dinner the night before the conference set just about the right tone? Erm, of course
that all helped, but I think it was the people. Jose - one of the organisers - said that all their work stopped at 
9 o'clock in the morning on the first day. Then it was all down to the attendees and the speakers to get together,
connect, chat and exchange experiences. Or just talk shite and have fun.

![Blathering idiot](/images/scan_agile_2025_blathering_idiot.jpg)

I was there to do my [legacy talk]({{< ref "/posts/worst_jobs_for_best_engineers.md" >}}), but mainly I was just glad
to have come to get the change to talk to lots of people. There's that P word again. People. It's not surprising that
at an agile conference, people will want to talk about people. I've long said that 80% of software engineering is 
social and only 20% technical. Especially nowadays "in this ever-changing landscape of revolutionary and groundbreaking
time of..." (I think that's enough to trigger [Eli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliskacejpova)) where Silicon Valley 
is trying to sell us on the idea that code will write itself and people just need to talk to the machine in the right 
way, it is important to focus on what people bring to the table.

# Story Time

Let's start at the beginning. [Linda](https://www.helloruby.com) opened the conference with introducing us to the first Programming Playground,
which she built in Helsinki. Linda is a techie turned children's author, and makes complex tech concepts accessible to 
children by getting them to play with cardboard models and more. And now children can jump on a keyboard in a park. What a great
idea! 

But what is even greater is the amount of thought that goes into public works in Finland. Playgrounds need to last, and they
are not just for playing but also for a social good. And one of the great experiences for Linda was to discover how
children are using the playground in ways she never imagined. They make up their own stories!

![Playground Construction](/images/scan_agile_2025_playground_construction.jpg)

Ah, stories. There's that other seemingly constant in our world. People need stories. People learn and communicate in 
stories. I was fascinated to learn from [Osita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osita-ifezue-0979b96a/) that after only 
20 minutes we tend to forget nearly half of what we're told. And that listening to stories is one of the 
ways that we can make concepts more memorable. He introduced us
to basic storytelling rules and structure and how culture is created by stories. And, as we know from Drucker: "Culture
eats Strategy for breakfast". Maybe that's why we're so _hungry_ for stories.

![Once Upon a Time](/images/scan_agile_2025_once_upon_a_time.jpg)

I always think that telling stories, telling people what went great and what failed is a really important skills for
any engineer. We don't work in isolation, we can't do it all ourselves. So we need to communicate, collaborate and
come together. And stories make that possible.

[Markus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-airila-401434163/) came next, and I really liked his talk because there is 
a bit of a fairy tale that I often hear:

> We can't use agile for something safety critical

Now, when I last heard that it was mentioned in the context of a financial app. Not exactly life and death stuff.
So I was particularly tickled by the story of "decommissioning a nuclear reactor using agile". Markus and team
spent 10 years planning and executing the clean-up of a reactor on a university campus. Now, that wasn't in some
remote location, but 5 minutes (by Moose) from where the conference was hosted. What can be more safety critical than
that?

![Nuclear Waste](/images/scan_agile_2025_nuclear_waste.jpg)

Instead of the usual waterfall approach, they worked in sprints. They iterated, even when it came to talking to 
regulators. Instead of trying to get everything together and 100% accurate first time, they entered a dialogue with
the officials. Chatted, asked questions and were able to get the right information. I would argue, regulators
are people too! ;-) So treat them as such! But how much easier is it when you can fix problems early!

Another point that I really liked about the decommissioning is that they pushed for transparency. Any issues were
collected as tickets, discussed and recorded to be able to do better next time. Their mantra was
to "just raise a ticket". And when there was an unexpected contaminated water leak, they didn't bury the story but proactively
told the public about it. That's how to build trust!

# Jira and Nuclear Waste

Now, I can't resist a jibe at Jira (yes, that's what they used), but it's not often that the Atlassian stack is
literally full of nuclear waste.

But seriously, if I hear "we can't use agile for something important" again, I know what to point to!

Let's move on, from safely decommissioning a reactor to guardrails: [Areti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%90%9D-areti-panou-01984a138) 
told us all about how we can get confidence
in our release pipelines. Continuing the thread of transparency and treating people like people, it's important to 
be open:

* Do we know whether we can trust the tests?
* Have we told people on support what was changed?
* Are we monitoring our build pipelines?
* Are we balancing avoiding and handling errors?

![Done](/images/scan_agile_2025_done.jpg)

Lots of really good questions there, and I also liked the emphasis on psychological safety. If you don't have a culture
where it's ok to raise doubts, warnings will not only go unheeded but also unspoken.

# My Turn

Then it was my turn to talk about legacy systems and why I think that people should learn COBOL (because so many
systems still provide value after lots and lots of years) but the people are retiring or otherwise disappearing. But I
also tried to convince people that legacy doesn't mean it's shite. You can learn a lot! For anyone really interested,
here's a recording when I did the [talk previously](https://youtu.be/nYO4dhQZk20).

# Did someone say COBOL?

Talking of COBOL, our Thursday closing keynote speaker - [Tricia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tricia-broderick/) - 
knows COBOL and is trying to get her children to learn.
Sensible move I think. 

Maybe less sensible was the idea one New Years Eve of betting she can do a handstand and
hold it for 10 seconds. The talk was a tour de force about resilience. It took 18 months of hard work, it took compassion,
confidence, courage and dealing with complexity. I really enjoyed reliving Tricia's journey and she weaved a fantastic 
story on what it means to be resilient. Mainly she confronted all the little lies she told herself. Like "I can't do it"
or "I need to do it on my own". I think it shows real strength to show vulnerability in admitting that it took lots of
work. And then she only went and did it. On stage. In front of hundreds of people. In heels. See for 
[yourself](https://youtu.be/7rBI_AYLZmw). Respect.

![I could not do THAT](/images/scan_agile_2025_i_could_not_do_that.jpg)

# Lies, More Lies!

Fast-forward to the next morning and the next keynote. [Sander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanderdur/) talked 
us through all the lies that organisations tell themselves. We started with a menti. Perhaps unsurprising, the audience 
decided that the biggest lie we tell ourselves is that "we are agile".

![Biggest lie](/images/scan_agile_2025_biggest_lie.jpg)

One by one, Sander dismantled all those comfortable things we tell ourselves. 

* "we are special", 
* "we just need more people to increase output", 
* "we can transfer knowledge easily", 
* "we can work on multiple things simultaneously", 
* "we need to scale"
* "reports in themselves are valuable"
* "AI will fix everything"
* "products provide value"

That last one is a bit funny. After all, don't we all want to be product-led organisations? What's the point of 
product owners if "products provide value" is a lie? Well, it's people. People use products to provide value. That
is a really important distinction. We just forget it too easily in my opinion. People are important, whereas products... 
meh, there's more than one way to achieve a goal.

That people point was driven home by [Justyna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/busy-being-happy/) later. 
Her talk was titled "Product Starts with People", and it contained
a really interesting observation: We have lots and lots of product metrics like customer satisfaction, conversion rates
and hundreds of other numbers. But what about the people that build the product? All to often we just have one number:
how many people are in the team? We don't know whether the team is happy or frustrated. We should apply a bit of systems
thinking and realise that people are at the centre. It costs a lot more to replace someone than just the hiring cost.

> People are not resources

I hate it when there is talk about "we need more resources" and mean people. Engineers (and managers for that matter)
are not interchangable bums on seats. It really pays dividends to make working fun. People who laugh together can work 
together, so why not invest in that. Make it fun, show your appreciation and find out what makes people tick.

![People Not Resources](/images/scan_agile_2025_people_not_resources.jpg)

That's the advice from a product manager, because the product is made by people, so she tries to look after them, connect
with them and provide the right environment. Simple!

# It's People, People!

There was one more people-centric talk I really enjoyed. That was [Pawel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelsucholbiak/) 
on "fighting tribal knowledge". He explained
how important knowledge is. It's that stuff that gets lost when Alfie retires or Bertie gets made redundant. And
documentation won't often save you.

Who hasn't got a confluence instance that is full of outdated stuff and you can never find the page that you are
looking for? I often found myself searching on Slack to find links to confluence pages, because the confluence search
is such a wasteland.

![Solve the Problem](/images/scan_agile_2025_solve_the_problem.jpg)

I really liked the idea of "do-not-bother-me duty" where team members are not allowed to be interrupted with questions
for a week. I see this not so much as a way of giving them some much-needed focus time, but as a way of showing
up bottlenecks. What is the thing that only Fred can do? 

We shouldn't be focussing on knowledge, rather focus on teaching and learning. So many skills and useful bits
of information are better learned by doing!

# But Won't AI Fix This?

I am a bit of an [AI sceptic]({{< ref "apocalyps_ai.md" >}}). I get triggered by it [quite badly]({{< ref "spearheading_nothing.md" >}}).
So when I read about MobAI twice in the program, my thinking was along the lines

> Here we go again, here comes the snakeoil

But I was intrigued enough to join a workshop run by [Kimmo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimmovatto/) and 
[Maarit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlaanti/) where we used AI to program a PiSloth as a mob, which
was fun. (Hehe, [child's play again](https://youtube.com/shorts/odlgRQwue9A))

![Robot Sloth](/images/scan_agile_2025_robot_sloth.jpg)

And then there was [Joe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joejustice/)'s closing keynote on MobAI. I have to admit that when I first read "ex-Tesla employee" my view
was clouded by the current shitbag of Muskian politics. But luckily I managed to snap out of it, and the more Joe talked
about how he built an EV racing team with agile methods, the more I listened. How wrong the preconception of "you can't do agile with 
hardware" is, too. Joe built teams around the same philosphy of Finland's [Future Crew](https://youtu.be/iw17c70uJes) 
that managed to create demos with hardware that was not thought possible. Eventually, he won the 24-hour Nürburgring 
by keeping it simple. Sticky tires and a light frame. Everything was kept as separate as possible and people focused on 
improving things iteratively.

![Burndown](/images/scan_agile_2025_burndown.jpg)

Just like mobbing. Just like agile. Or how agile should be before the certification salespeople and big consultancies
get their hands on it. That enabled him to build a new road-legal car in a week. When he went to Tesla, the modularisation
meant that new car parts could be created in 45 minutes. Now he's doing the same at Toyota. So much so that the 
famous Toyota method has been thrown out. Do I hear a million agile voices cry out at once?

# Enter MobAI

So how does AI fit in? Well, it was refreshingly people-centric. Joe proposes the following way of mobbing:

* a driver does the actual job (programming, building car parts, creating music)
* a navigator advises the driver

so far so normal

* an AI-wrangler (not its official title) consults an AI model and passes relevant information on to the navigator
* the AI-wrangler also records the things that help the driver

By collecting three simple things:

* Question
* Context
* Answer

The AI-wrangle basically builds up a knowledge base that gets fed into the model

![Three Things](/images/scan_agile_2025_three_things.jpg)

# This where it gets good

Now, one of the things that is really important is that the model that is trained is *your own model*. Don't train
ChatGPT or Claude, train your own model. Why should the Silicon Valley techbros benefit from all your knowledge? 
The know-how that you feed into the model is value, at the end you could sell it. Why would you give it away for free?

# Well, this is unexpected

As I'm writing this I am still try to grasp the implications. This way of using AI makes even a grump AI-sceptic
like me sit up and take notice. This makes sense, the people aren't replaced by an AI, they just get another tool.
Separating the driver and navigator from the tedium of trying to prompt the LLM to spit out the right information 
allows them to focus on the task at hand. The AI-wrangler can pay attention to the discussions between the driver
and navigator and record the relevant and useful bits.

Best bit of all: this doesn't require a fancy all-singing, all-dancing model. Joe says he's using Llama2 on his
laptop.

Well, well, well. Very interesting!

# More Cowbell

I loved ScanAgile. It was chilled, interesting, exciting and felt like all those people I never met are long-lost
friends. If you get the chance, go! You'll learn something new! And you'll meet cool people.

And that's what it is about. People!
