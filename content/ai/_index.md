All the posts, articles and opinions on this page are my own. 100% organic and non-AI generated. 

There are a couple of images that were Dall-E generated when I was playing with it and hadn't become cynical and
sceptical enough about the stochastic parrots yet. 

I've written a few posts about [generative AI](/tags/generative-ai/) and I'd call myself a sceptic and don't really
want to waste lots of compute, energy and water on feeding the hallucinating misinformation machine.

At the same time, I'm not trying to be blinkered and open to thinking that it's going to be useful in some areas,
just not every damn use case.
